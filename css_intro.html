            1. The Evolving Role of Software</p><p>
<b class="center">Today, software takes on a dual role. It is a product and, at the same time, the vehicle for 
delivering a product. </b>
As a product, it delivers the computing potential embodied by computer hardware or, more 
broadly, a network of <h1 style ="border: 2px solid blueviolet;">computers that are accessible by local hardware</h1>. Whether it resides within 
a cellular phone or operates inside a mainframe computer, software is information transformer—
producing, managing, acquiring, modifying, displaying, or transmitting information that can be 
as simple as a single bit or <p style="background:hsla(4, 34%, 55%, 1 bbbbvcx);">complex as a multimedia presentation.</p>
As the vehicle used to deliver the product, software acts as the basis for the control of the 
computer (operating systems), the communication of information (networks), and the creation 
and control of other programs (software tools and environments).
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(4, 34%, 55%);">Software delivers the most important product of our time information</h1>. Software transforms 
personal data (e.g., an individual’s financial transactions) so that the data can be more useful in a 
local context; it manages business information to enhance competitiveness; it provides a gateway 
to worldwide information networks (e.g., Internet) and provides the means for acquiring 
information in all of its forms.
<h1 style="background-color: rgb(222,45,65);">The role of computer software has undergone significant change over a time span</h1> of little more 
than 50 years. Dramatic improvements in hardware performance, ―Ideas and technological
discoveries are the driving engines of economic growth.‖
Popular books published during the 1970s and 1980s provide useful historical insight into the 
changing perception of computers and software and their impact on our culture.
